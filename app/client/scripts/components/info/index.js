                        <h2>About Us</h2>
                        <p>Kris[toffer] is from Sweden, the country! But he lived in
                        Seattle for about 14 years before moving to New York. Razi is
                        from Kansas, the midwest! But she lived in Seattle for
                        roughly 10 years. Kris met Razi on a short visit back to
                        Seattle on New Years Eve thanks to one of their mutual
                        best friends Sara Fisher (thanks Sara!!).</p>

                        <p>Now they live together in Brooklyn with their cat.
                        Kris is a web designer and Razi is a graphic designer.
                        They both really like to travel, eat pizza, drink
                        champagne on New Years, be on boats, and design cool
                        things.</p>

                        <p>On a short trip to Montreal last October, Kris brought
                        along an engagement ring to ask Razi to marry him. Before
                        he could do anything smooth though, Razi put her dumb
                        cold hands in his pocket to warm up and found the ring.</p>

                        <p>(She said yes.)</p>
